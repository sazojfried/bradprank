# Pandemic: Yale Edition – Game Manual

## 1. Overview

This is a campus-scale social-contagion simulator inspired by *Pandemic 2*. Instead of diseases, you control digital-era social forces that spread across Yale’s 11 territories (collapsed from 14 residential colleges). Your goal is to reshape campus life before Yale “develops a cure” through policy, norms, and community rebuilding.

## 2. Pathogen Types

* **Algorithm (Virus)** – fast, volatile, attention-hijacking.
  * Represents algorithmic feeds, TikTok/Instagram dopamine loops, instant gratification, and distracted behavior informed by readings on tech and neuroplasticity.
* **Platform Culture (Bacteria)** – stable, behavioral, norm-shifting.
  * Represents dating apps, public shaming, filter bubbles, and platform-shaped relationship norms.
* **Loneliness (Parasite)** – slow, hidden, structural.
  * Represents the loneliness epidemic, the loss of third places, and digital substitutes for physical community.
* Choose one at the beginning of each game. **Algorithm is the default**, mirroring Virus in *Pandemic 2*.

## 3. Map and Territories

The canvas shows an abstracted Yale campus. Each circle represents a residential college: Branford/Saybrook, Trumbull, Hopper, Jonathan Edwards, Davenport, Pierson, Berkeley, Timothy Dwight, Silliman, Morse/Stiles, Franklin/Murray. Hover over a college to see its infection percentage. Lines between colleges represent foot-traffic routes.

## 4. Transmission Vectors

* **Foot-Traffic Vector**
  * Unlocks when campus infection warms up.
  * Sends infection along walkable paths between neighboring colleges.
* **Dining-Hall Vector**
  * Unlocks later.
  * Spreads infection between colleges with dining halls.
* **Social Media Vector**
  * Always active.
  * Spreads infection via digital channels between any pair of colleges, regardless of distance.
  * The only early-game way to reach Franklin/Murray.

## 5. Resistances

Each college resists spread differently:

* **Physical-Distance Resistance** – remote colleges are slightly safer from in-person spread.
* **Architectural Resistance** – closed or maze-like colleges slow in-person and dining-hall infection.
* **Social-Cohesion Resistance** – strong internal community slows internal growth and digital influence.

You’ll notice some colleges infect faster (Silliman, Hopper) and others more slowly (JE, Trumbull, Franklin/Murray).

## 6. Symptoms and Visibility

At low infection levels, the pathogen’s effects are subtle: more phone checks, impatience, weaker in-person ties. As infection rises, visible symptoms appear:

* **Algorithm:** distracted walking, short attention spans, TikTok/Instagram fixation.
* **Platform Culture:** dating-app burnout, ghosting norms, public-shaming spikes.
* **Loneliness:** withdrawal from events, collapse of informal “third places,” chronic disconnection.

Once a college passes a visibility threshold, it’s considered visibly infected, which accelerates Yale’s cure efforts.

## 7. Cure and Government Response

The **Cure Progress bar** represents Yale’s blend of regulation, institutional response, and rebuilt community. Cure research is slow at first, then speeds up as more colleges show visible symptoms and overall infection rises. As the cure advances, campus reacts by tightening foot-traffic, reducing dining-hall contact, and weakening all vectors.

## 8. Winning and Losing

* **Win:** Infect all 11 colleges (near 100% infection in each) before the cure reaches 100%.
* **Lose:** If the cure hits 100% before full infection, the outbreak is contained and Yale preserves its pre-pathogen social order.
* Replay with different pathogen types to explore spread patterns.

## 9. Controls

* **Choose Pathogen** – select Algorithm, Platform Culture, or Loneliness from the dropdown before starting.
* **Start** – begins the simulation.
* **Pause** – pauses the simulation.
* **Reset** – resets the game to a fresh outbreak.
* All spread, cure, and policy actions are automated in this version.

## 10. Credits / Concept

Concept is based on *Pandemic 2* mechanics and readings about tech-driven attention capture, dating apps and changing norms, filter bubbles and public shaming, and the loneliness epidemic/third-place decline. The game is a playful response to those ideas on a real campus map.
