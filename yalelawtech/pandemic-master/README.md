========

Static build
------------
A compiled static version of the game now lives in `static/`. Open `static/index.html` directly in a browser or deploy the entire `static/` directory to any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages or Cloudflare) to play without running Middleman.

Legacy Middleman setup
----------------------
You make a disease and try to spread it around.
This is weekend side project. I like the flash game
Pandemic 2 but I wish there was more. More countries,
better ui, more, more!.
