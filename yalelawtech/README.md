# Pandemic: Yale Edition

A browser-based, Pandemic 2–style simulation where modern social contagions sweep across Yale’s residential colleges. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no bundlers or frameworks required.

## Play

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The game runs entirely client-side and is ready for GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages deployment from this repository.

## Files

- `index.html` – main layout with controls, canvas map, and news feed.
- `styles.css` – dark, minimal styling for the UI and map.
- `game.js` – simulation logic and rendering.
- `manual.md` – full manual describing mechanics, controls, and win/lose conditions.

## Deployment

Serve the `yalelawtech` folder as static files. For Cloudflare Pages, set the project root to this folder so `index.html` is served directly.

## Learn more

See `manual.md` for a complete explanation of pathogen types, vectors, resistances, cure mechanics, and tips.
